## Why am I doing this?

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the knowledge and skills that I have gained during the DfE Skills bootcamp provided by qa. 

I shall be using the Spring Boot framework to build a Java application that that interfaces with a local MySQL relational database, a h2 in-memory database will be used for testing. 

Project planning will be achieved using [this](https://liambass1.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/QBP/boards/1) Jira board.
